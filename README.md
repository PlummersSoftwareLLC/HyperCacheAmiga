# HyperCacheAmiga

Source code to the 1980s Amiga product, version dated 1992

A fellow named Matthew Kott reached out and asked me to release the source code to HyperCache if I still had it, so I dug around, and sure enough I did, so I opted to post it here on Github.

For various legal and liability reasons, I cannot open-source it at this time, but it's yours to explore and tinker with for nostalgia. For one, this means that PRs on this repository will be closed without consideration. Do feel free to create issues for things that don't work when you try using it, so others can take note of them. For one, if anyone still has Lattice C out there, I'd love to hear if it can still be compiled!<br/>
At the same time, don't expect any issues that _are_ opened to be addressed either.

If there's sufficient interest, I'll look into the logistics of open-sourcing it.  For now, though, it remains (c) 1992 Silicon Prairie Software.

Authorship:  Primarily Dave Plummer, though it was initially kindled by a sample that I found which showed how to hook the disk driver, and that code likely remains.  Also, I ultimately hired someone to work on V2.0 once I got to Microsoft, as I was pretty busy, but now I don't have a name!  So some of the code was written by someone else on contract, but I'm still trying to figure out who!

Thanks to Matthew for thinking to ask!

Dave
