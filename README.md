# HyperCacheAmiga
Source code to the 1980s Amiga product, version dated 1992

A fellow named Matthew Kott reached out and asked me to release the source code to HyperCache if I still had it, so I dug around, and sure enough I did, so I opted to post it here on Github.

For various legal and liability reasons, I cannot open-source it at this time, but it's yours to explore and tinker with for nostalgia.  If anyone still has Lattice C out there, I'd love to hear if it can still be compiled!

If there's sufficient interest, I'll look into the logistics of open-sourcing it.  For now, though, it remains (c) 1992 Silicon Prairie Software.
